# Asset Management Analysis Report

---

## 🔎 Overview
Asset management is a critical component of a security plan. It involves tracking organizational assets, assessing risks associated with them, and implementing measures to protect sensitive information.  

In this scenario, a home office with multiple network-connected devices was analyzed to create an inventory and classify assets by sensitivity.

---

## 🛠️ Asset Identification
Three representative devices on the home network were identified:

1. **Desktop Computer**
   - Owner: Home office user
   - Location: Home office desk
   - Type: Primary workstation
   - Sensitivity: High (contains business documents and sensitive client data)

2. **Smartphone**
   - Owner: Home office user
   - Location: Personal mobile device
   - Type: Communication and mobile access
   - Sensitivity: Medium (accesses email and business apps)

3. **External Hard Drive**
   - Owner: Home office user
   - Location: Home office storage
   - Type: Storage device for backups
   - Sensitivity: High (contains backups of business-critical data)

> Additional devices (router, printer, webcam, etc.) were also inventoried and classified based on access to sensitive information.

## 🔒 Classification & Sensitivity
- **High Sensitivity**: Devices containing business-critical or personal identifiable information (PII), financial records, or backups.  
- **Medium Sensitivity**: Devices used for communication or app access with moderate risk.  
- **Low Sensitivity**: Peripheral devices (e.g., printer, speakers) with minimal risk if compromised.

---

## 📊 Inventory Tracking
- All devices were recorded in an **Excel inventory sheet** (`inventory.xlsx`) including:
  - Device name and type  
  - Owner and location  
  - Sensitivity level  
  - Notes on usage and protection measures  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
By implementing this asset management process:
- All network devices were **identified and classified**.  
- Sensitive assets were flagged for **extra protection**.  
- This inventory provides a baseline for ongoing **risk assessment** and **security compliance**.

Regular updates to the inventory ensure that new devices are tracked and classified, reducing the risk of security incidents.
