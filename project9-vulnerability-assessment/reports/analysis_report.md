# Vulnerability Assessment Report

---

## üñ•Ô∏è System Description
- Hardware: High-performance CPU, 128GB memory  
- OS: Latest Linux distribution  
- Database: MySQL with SSL/TLS connections  
- Network: IPv4, stable connection, interacts with other servers  

---

## üéØ Scope
- Focus: **Access controls of the database server**  
- Duration: 3-month assessment period  
- Framework: NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1  

---

## üìå Purpose
The database server stores **customer, campaign, and analytics data** used for marketing operations.  
As a critical business asset, any compromise can disrupt operations and damage customer trust.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment
| Threat Source | Threat Event                                | Likelihood (1-3) | Severity (1-3) | Risk Score |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Hacker        | Data exfiltration (stealing sensitive info) | 3                | 3              | 9          |
| Employee      | Disrupt mission-critical operations         | 2                | 3              | 6          |
| Customer      | Alter/Delete critical data                  | 1                | 3              | 3          |

## üõ°Ô∏è Remediation Strategy
1. **Access Control Improvements**  
   - Strong password policy  
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)  
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  

2. **Audit & Monitoring**  
   - Enable database logging  
   - Monitor suspicious access attempts  

3. **Encryption**  
   - Use **TLS** instead of SSL for secure data in transit  

4. **Network Restrictions**  
   - Apply IP allow-listing (restrict database access to trusted networks only)  

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
The **publicly exposed database server** is a high-risk vulnerability.  
Restricting access, enforcing strong authentication, and applying network-based controls will significantly reduce the risk of data exfiltration and operational disruption.
