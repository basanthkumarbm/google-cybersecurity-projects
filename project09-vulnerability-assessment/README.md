# Vulnerability Assessment: Database Server Security

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **vulnerability assessment** performed on an e-commerce company’s remote database server.  
The assessment identifies critical security weaknesses, evaluates risks, and proposes remediation strategies to reduce exposure.  

---

## 🏢 Scenario
- The company operates remotely with employees accessing a **centralized MySQL database server**.  
- The database has been **open to the public** since the company’s launch (3 years).  
- This poses a **serious security risk** as sensitive customer and campaign data may be exposed to unauthorized users.
