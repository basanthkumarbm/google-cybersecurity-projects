# Analyzed Network Attacks: SYN Flood Incident Report

---

## üîé Section 1: Attack Identification
One potential explanation for the website‚Äôs **connection timeout error** is a **Denial of Service (DoS) attack**.  

The captured logs show that the **web server stopped responding** after being overloaded with a large volume of **SYN packet requests**.  
This behavior is consistent with a **SYN flood attack**, which is a specific type of DoS attack.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Section 2: Attack Impact on Website Functionality
When website visitors attempt to connect to the web server, the process relies on the **TCP three-way handshake**:

1. A **SYN packet** is sent from the client (source) to the server (destination) to request a connection.  
2. The server replies with a **SYN-ACK packet** to accept the connection and reserves resources for it.  
3. The client responds with an **ACK packet**, completing the handshake and establishing the connection.  

In a **SYN flood attack**:
- A malicious actor sends a massive number of **SYN packets** all at once.  
- The web server reserves resources for each incoming SYN request but never receives the final ACK to complete the handshake.  
- As a result, the server‚Äôs resources are **consumed and exhausted**, leaving no capacity to handle legitimate connections.  

---

## üìâ Observed Outcome
- The logs confirm that the **web server was overwhelmed** by the abnormal SYN traffic.  
- The server was unable to process new requests, causing legitimate visitors to experience **connection timeout errors**.

## üõ°Ô∏è Section 3: Recommendations
To mitigate SYN flood attacks and strengthen resilience against similar threats, the following measures are recommended:

- **Enable SYN cookies** ‚Äì Prevents the server from allocating resources until the handshake is completed.  
- **Implement rate limiting** ‚Äì Restricts the number of SYN requests accepted per second.  
- **Deploy a firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS)** ‚Äì Filters out abnormal or suspicious traffic.  
- **Use load balancers** ‚Äì Distributes traffic across multiple servers to reduce the risk of overload.  
- **Leverage cloud-based DDoS protection** ‚Äì Offloads and absorbs large volumes of malicious traffic before it reaches the server.  
- **Monitor traffic patterns** ‚Äì Continuous monitoring and alerting can help detect abnormal traffic spikes early.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
The incident was caused by a **SYN flood attack**, a type of DoS attack that exhausted server resources and led to website downtime.  
By applying the recommended mitigation strategies, the organization can reduce its exposure to SYN flood attacks and maintain better availability of its online services.
